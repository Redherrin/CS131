The helpfulness value would definitely vary a lot between different customers. Some people write a non-descript sentence about the product that won't get many votes. Others may write long and detailed reviews that will get a lot of votes. Others might write funny captions that will also get a decent amount of votes. Some people might also consistenly write long detailed reviews, while others may only do it for products they either really love or hate. I think it would be unlikely for customers' helpfulness scores to be similar.

I also think the helpfulness scores of products would be wildly different from each other. Exceptionally bad or good products will probably get a lot more helpfulness votes from people complaining/praising the products. More popular products would simply have more votes just from having more customers compared to less known products.

In the examples I chose, you can even see how they range from ~4 to somewhere in the 20s on average, for both customers and product scores. Customers seem to overall have less helpfulness votes than products, which does make sense since a customer would have to make many helpful reviews to catch up.
